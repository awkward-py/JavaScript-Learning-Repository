### 1. `for` Loop:

#### Definition:
The `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either an array, a string, or an object).

#### Syntax:
```javascript
for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

#### Example:
```javascript
let userName = 'awkwardpy';

// Print "Hello, awkwardpy!" three times
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log('Iteration ' + (i + 1) + ': Hello, ' + userName + '!');
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Initialization (`let i = 0`):** This part is executed before the loop starts. It initializes the loop counter variable (`i` in this case) to a starting value.
- **Condition (`i < 3`):** The loop continues to run as long as this condition is `true`.
- **Iteration (`i++`):** This part is executed after each iteration of the loop. It increments the loop counter variable.

### 2. `while` Loop:

#### Definition:
The `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

#### Syntax:
```javascript
while (condition) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

#### Example:
```javascript
let userName = 'awkwardpy';
let count = 0;

// Print "Hello, awkwardpy!" until count reaches 3
while (count < 3) {
  console.log('Iteration ' + (count + 1) + ': Hello, ' + userName + '!');
  count++;
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Condition (`count < 3`):** The loop continues to run as long as this condition is `true`.
- **Code Block:** The code inside the loop is executed until the condition becomes `false`.
- **Iteration (`count++`):** This part is essential to avoid an infinite loop. It increments the counter variable (`count` in this case) within the loop.

### Key Points:
- Both `for` and `while` loops are used for repetitive tasks.
- Ensure proper initialization, condition, and iteration to control the loop flow.
- Be cautious about infinite loops; always ensure that the condition will eventually become `false`.
- `for` loops are commonly used when the number of iterations is known, while `while` loops are used when the condition depends on runtime values.

Understanding these loop structures is crucial for effective JavaScript programming, as they enable you to perform repetitive tasks efficiently.
